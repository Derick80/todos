## Fly Setup

1. [Install `flyctl`](https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/installing-flyctl/)

2. Sign up and log in to Fly

```sh
flyctl auth signup
```

3. Setup Fly. It might ask if you want to deploy, say no since you haven't built the app yet.

```sh
flyctl launch
```

4. To set up prisma I have to ssh into my instance and manually push the scema. I also had to change directories from base to /app to be in the correct place.

notes about deployment: Remember to modify callback_urls to production call backs.

fly deploy
fly ssh console -s
--pick instance. For some reason only the 2nd one worked
then
cd app
npx prisma db push

## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Deployment

If you've followed the setup instructions already, all you need to do is run this:

```sh
npm run deploy
```

You can run `flyctl info` to get the url and ip address of your server.

Check out the [fly docs](https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/node/) for more information.
